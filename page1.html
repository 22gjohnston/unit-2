  <h1>Should you fire an employee with cancer?
  </h1>
  <h2> Dilemma:</h2>

<p2> What makes this delemia so hard is trying to find the balance between your income and employes happiness. An argument for keeping him would be that. hes a functional worker and will come in over time. Most nonprofit organization try to keep their workers first. He still is a functional employe and should not be treated any different. An argument for firing him would be that the less money raised is less for the neady people. Having him as an employe means that you and your company is losing money. If you fire him and hire someone to take his place, you will raise alot more money.</h2>
