  <h1>Should you fire an employee with cancer?
  </h1>
  <h2> Dilemma:</h2>

<p2> You are a manager at a nonprofit organization. Your employee has been busy at chemotherapy and does not have time to work. In 6 months time he will take a break from chemo, but still cant come in work most days. He says he wants to work to keep his family at a steady income.</h2>
