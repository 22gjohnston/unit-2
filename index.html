  </h1>
  <h2> Facts:</h2>

<p2> You are a manager at a nonprofit organization and starting a fundraiser for the needy. Your employee has been busy at chemotherapy and does not have time to work. In 6 months time he will take a break from chemo, but still cant come in for work alot of the days days. He says he wants to work to keep his family at a steady income, but he only brings in half the income the rest of the workers bring in.</h2></h2>
